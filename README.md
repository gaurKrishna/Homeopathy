Welcome

HOMEOPATHY

This is my final project for cs50-introduction to computer science, is a web based application to digitalize the work of a non government organization which provides homeopathic medical services.

The organisation at present maintains a database of its patients in form of hand written register and by now they have accumulated piles of registers and it becomes quite difficult for the doctors to search for the patients in the records even after having their unique IDs, also there have been many patients which visited their clinic only once or didn't come for a long time which also adds to the database.

This web application allows the organization to :-
1. Add new patients into the data base.
2. View medical history of the patients.
3. Update the medical history of the patients on each visits.
4. Remove passive users(users which have not been to a clinic in last one year) based on city name provided.
